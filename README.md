# seria, lein-seria and the wiki are WORK IN PROGRESS

# seria
seria is a schema-based serialization library. Using a rich set of built in types,
you define your 'schemas' and seria generates tailor-made functions to handle any
data conforming to your schemas. It is efficient, simple to setup/use, and handles
all **edn** values.

For more information, please check out the [wiki](https://github.com/moxaj/seria/wiki).
