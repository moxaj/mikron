# mikron (WORK IN PROGRESS)
**mikron** is a schema-based serialization library for clojure(script). Using a rich
set of built in types, you define your schemas and mikron generates tailor-made
functions to handle any data conforming to your schemas. It is efficient,
simple to setup/use, and handles all **edn** values.
